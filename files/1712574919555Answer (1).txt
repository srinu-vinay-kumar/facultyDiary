Sure, let's consider a supermarket as an example for ABC analysis:
- Category A: These are the top performer products with high annual consumption. For instance, in a supermarket, these could be items like milk, bread, and eggs. These items are in high demand and bring the most revenue to the business. They represent about 20% of the total items but contribute to about 70% of the revenue.
- Category B: These are products with medium consumption value. They might include items like canned goods or personal care products. These items are not in high daily demand but do sell steadily. They represent about 30% of the total items and contribute to about 25% of the revenue.
- Category C: These are low-revenue product categories, the slow movers, and the rarely sold items. They might include items like gourmet spices or specialty kitchen gadgets. These items represent the majority of the inventory (about 50%) but only contribute to about 5% of the revenue.
By using ABC analysis, the supermarket can prioritize its inventory management efforts, focusing more on Category A items, which have the most significant impact on revenue. This way, they can ensure that these items are always in stock and can manage their resources more efficiently.
